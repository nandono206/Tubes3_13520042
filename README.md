# DNA Sequence Matcher

**DNA Sequence Matcher** is a web application than can
be used to match a DNA sequence submitted by users with
a database of disease-identifying nucleotide sequences.
If a segment of the submitted DNA matches the database, 
the DNA sample will be flagged as positive, and vice versa. 
A history of app usage will be stored in the database.

Users' inputs are sanitised using regex. The sequence 
matcher implements the Knutt-Morris-Pratt algorithm and 
the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
